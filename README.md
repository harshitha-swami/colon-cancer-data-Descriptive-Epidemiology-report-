# Descriptive Epidemiology of Lung and Bronchus Cancer  
**PUBH 3351 - Epidemiology and Vital Statistics**  
*Authors: Audrey Cortes, Alaina Le, Harshitha Swaminathan*  

## Overview  
This project analyzes **lung and bronchus cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates** in the U.S., California, Kentucky, and Texas, stratified by **race/ethnicity, sex, and smoking prevalence**. It identifies disparities and proposes an intervention to improve survival outcomes.  

## Key Findings  
- **Kentucky** has the highest lung cancer mortality; **Hispanic populations** have the lowest.  
- **California** has the highest **5-year survival rate (29.2%)**, while **Kentucky has the lowest (23.3%)**.  
- **Females** have higher survival rates than males across all states.  
- **Smoking prevalence** is highest in **Kentucky** and among **males**.  

## Proposed Intervention  
A **cohort study** in Kentucky testing **smoking cessation education** for lung cancer patients. **Success is measured by smoking reduction after six months**.
