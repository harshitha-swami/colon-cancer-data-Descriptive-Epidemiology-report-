Descriptive Epidemiology of Lung and Bronchus Cancer
PUBH 3351 - Epidemiology and Vital Statistics
Authors: Audrey Cortes, Alaina Le, Harshitha Swaminathan

Project Overview
This project investigates lung and bronchus cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates in the United States, California, Kentucky, and Texas, stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, and smoking prevalence. Using publicly available epidemiological data, we analyze disparities in cancer outcomes and discuss potential interventions to reduce these disparities.

Key Objectives
Compare lung and bronchus cancer mortality rates (2018-2022) across race/ethnicity in the U.S., California, Kentucky, and Texas.
Examine 5-year survival rates stratified by geographic location, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Identify smoking prevalence trends across different demographic groups using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data.
Investigate disparities in lung cancer outcomes and discuss potential public health interventions.
Data Sources

Smoking prevalence by state, sex, and race/ethnicity
Findings

Mortality Disparities:
Kentucky has the highest lung cancer mortality rates across all racial groups.
Hispanic populations consistently show the lowest mortality rates.

Survival Disparities:
California has the highest 5-year survival rate (29.2%), while Kentucky has the lowest (23.3%).
Females have significantly higher survival rates than males across all states.
Hispanic individuals generally have better survival outcomes compared to Non-Hispanic White and Black populations.

Smoking Prevalence:
Kentucky has the highest prevalence of smokers.
Males are more likely to smoke than females across all states.
Asian populations in California and Texas have the highest proportion of non-smokers.

Proposed Intervention
A prospective cohort study is designed to test the impact of smoking cessation education among lung cancer patients in Kentucky. 
The study:
Randomly assigns patients to an educational intervention or standard care group.
Measures smoking cessation rates after 6 months.
Uses relative risk (RR) to quantify the impact of smoking education on quitting behavior.
